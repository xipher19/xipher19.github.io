										<h1>The ERU Hub</h1>
									</header>

									<p>In the past two weeks, I’ve focused on improving the auditory cortex, to match the detail and requirements in the Beads primer / design notes.</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>The Auditory Cortex and the ERU Hub</h2>
									<h3>A1</h3>

									<p>Let us talk some more about <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/static/files/publications/_old/2009%20Ma%20Pouget.pdf">population coding</a>. In essence, it means viewing the cortical stimulus as a whole. When we move from independent, intricate action potentials to abstract ideas, higher neurons have to make a holistic sense of detail. The spectrotemporal receptive fields in the primary auditory cortex are examples of such neurons. This group of neurons have affinities to frequency spectra, periodicity and temporal spikes. For example, if a neuron has to match with the sound <i>aaaaaa</i>, the frequency spectrum will be narrow, the temporal window wide and periodicity low. In contrast, if a neuron is looking for the sound <i>ur</i>, the frequency spectrum will be wide while the temporal window is narrow. So a massive population of such neurons sit in the primary cortices, looking for patterns, and firing when close matches are found. As a result, those synapses trigger abstract sections of the brain.</p>

									<h3>A2 and beyond</h3>

									<p>As we know, spike trains typically represent instantaneous stimulus. For example, consider an image of a car, a shrill sound, a tangy taste or a sweet smell. You can probably infer that these stimuli, in silo, lack context. However, a mature brain will tag multimodal temporal information and prior cognitive processing as contextual information to them; so “I'm currently in a Mercedes dealership, so the car is a Mercedes”, the image of a metal piece links it to the shrill sound, “I'm eating pasta”, “I'm in a honey market, so the sweet smell must be from honey” become the corresponding context for those examples. This principle is at the core of biological reasoning.</p>

									<p>To further understand why cortices are essential, let's take a look at their Beads-specific conceptual twin - the ERU hub. The ERU hub acts as the gateway manager for information before it enters the brain. The multilevel ERU hub (equivalent to A2, A3 and beyond) routes stimulus for different bursts of information. The sound aaaa can be the start of “Amelia” or “Amazing”, so the hub deciphers the correct section of the brain to route to. However, a natural follow up to the above would be “how shallow or deep should the hub be? If it's too shallow, you end up with a single level of routes. If it's too deep, you risk neural fatigue”. The systemic brain has different answers to that for different velocities of thinking -</p>

									<ol>
										<li>Slow thinking / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis">Neurogenesis</a> - When new neurons are created, detail is prioritized over efficiency, so there aren’t many direct connections to the Hub for that particular stimulus. <i>Side note: notice how you hold great nuance for new skills / topics you just learn about? This is because newly created “long chain” synapses are biologically “fresh” and can hold neurotransmitter links and vesicles for longer</i></li>
										<li>Fast thinking - When mature neurons / topics are “invoked”, the brain focuses on moving quickly from synapse to synapse. So, the abstract neurons representing these intuitive topics are closer to the hub</li>
