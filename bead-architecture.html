									<h1>The Bead<br />
									 Architecture</h1>
									<p>A micro collaborative vector architecture that synthesizes 'beads'<br />
									with cognition of the entire ecosystem. <a class = "scrolly" href="#main-content" style="color:#A9A9A9" >Read on for more.</a></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/AI Generated Image - Beads.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p id="main-content">The bead architecture is a multi-modal association architecture where 'beads' / nodes interact with each other perpetually via a constructive medium at a rich and fine level,
									enabling intelligence for a diverse set of goals. On its own, the architecture constitutes the knowledge framework but in addition to an 'intent' and the perpetual constructive medium,
									it transforms into an intelligence framework.</p>

								<p>While the architecture supports an exponential increase in degrees of freedom, meticulous-and-seamless implementation is equally crucial for superior results.</p>

								<h3> Design Philosophy </h3>
								
								<p> It is important to note that the framework is <b>purely</b> a Machine Learning framework with little scope of AGI scale autonomy (for now; the autonomy is part of a different module). This design 
									is intentional as the framework can target applications requiring high perception but low imagination and consciousness.</p>

								<h3>Salient Features</h3>
								<ul>
  									<li><b>Removal of training / testing distinction</b></li>
  									<li><b>Mathematically mild</b></li>
									<li><b>No concept of overfitting / underfitting due to the dearth of mathematical differentiable/continuous functions</b></li>
									<li><b>Scales insanely well</b></li>
									<li><b>Perception is solely dependent on the exposure, hence many loss-related issues are avoided</b></li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3> How does it work? </h3>

								<p>As noted before, the framework is perpetual in the sense that we don't have distinct training and deployment. Every operation works on live beads and concurrency is appropriately controlled. But for development
									and implementation purposes, we divide the framework into three distinct structures -</p>
								<ul>
  									<li>ERU (Environment Response Unit) - This is the core bead responsible for association, storage and "neuroplasticity" in the framework</li>
  									<li>Conduction medium - This is a medium responsible for receiving and generating stimuli to the ERUs. This structure ensures perpetuality</li>
									<li>CMU (Communication Unit) - These beads are essentially responsible for integration with sensors and actuators outside the <i>bead world</i>. They are analagous to firmwire drivers</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p><b><i> Note - As an old-school researcher, the architecture is intricately designed and developed on (literal) paper. Alongside the implementation, I'm slowly moving the design to a digital/website form. </i></b></p>
