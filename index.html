									<h1>The Beads<br />
									 Framework</h1>
									<p>A micro-collaborative 'bead' ecosystem that enables <br />
									multi-modal cognition, task autonomy and adaptive intelligence. <a class = "scrolly" href="#main-content" style="color:#A9A9A9" >Read on for more.</a></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/AI Generated Image - Beads.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<p><b><i> Note - As an old-school researcher, the architecture is intricately designed and developed on (literal) paper. Alongside the implementation, I'm slowly moving the design to a digital/website form. </i></b></p>
																
								<p id="main-content">The bead architecture is a multi-modal association architecture where nodes (a.k.a beads) perpetually interact with each other with the assistance of a constructive medium at a rich and fine level.
									On its own, the architecture constitutes the knowledge framework but in addition to an 'intent' and the perpetual constructive medium,
									it transforms into an intelligence for a diverse set of goals.</p>

								<p>Though the architecture supports an explosion in degrees of freedom, meticulous and seamless implementation is equally crucial for achieving its goals.</p>
								
								<h3>Salient Features</h3>
								<ul>
  									<li><b>Removal of the training / testing distinction</b></li>
  									<li><b>Mathematically simple</b></li>
									<li><b>Absence of overfitting / underfitting as parameters scale with complexity</b></li>
									<li><b>Excellent model scaling</b></li>
									<li><b>Perception is solely dependent on the exposure, hence loss-related bottlenecks are avoided</b></li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3> What are beads? </h3>

								<p>As noted before, the framework is perpetual and lacks distinct training and deployment cycles. Every operation is performed on live beads and concurrency is appropriately controlled. For development
									and implementation purposes, the framework is divided into four distinct structures -</p>
								<ul>
  									<li>ERU (Environment Response Unit) - This is the core bead responsible for association, storage and "neuroplasticity" in the framework</li>
  									<li>Conduction medium - This is a medium responsible for receiving and generating stimuli from/to the ERUs. This structure ensures perpetuality</li>
									<li>CMU (Communication Unit) - These beads are essentially responsible for integration with sensors and actuators outside the bead ecosystem. They are analagous to firmware drivers</li>
									<li>Motivation targets - A specialized structure responsible for housing freeform intent such as "drive the autonomous vehicle safely", "take care of the house", etc; essentially the <i>purpose</i> of the ecosystem.</li>
								</ul>

								<p><i>It is important, however, to distinguish motivation from rigid instructions. Freeform motivation gives the ecosystem the freedom to adapt itself for accountability, responsibility and reliability.</i></p>

								<h3> Design Philosophy </h3>
								
								<p> It is important to note that the ecosystem is just an enhanced Machine Learning framework (with directed motivation) but falls short of AGI scale autonomy. This design is intended to target applications 
									requiring high perception and adaptability.</p>

								<h3> Learning plan</h3>

								<p> An advantage (and apparent disadvantage) of a spatial model is that it <i>learns</i> from all dimensions (versus a feedforward style). When the model is initialized for the very first time, it lacks the awareness 
									or the knowledge of its environment. Hence, it is tuned to be in an autopilot mode and continuously learn from stimulus and exposure. </p>
									
								<p> The quality of training entirely depends on the exposure - not in the classical sense of datasets but rather the multi-modal stimuli. It is important to note that the maturity of the model determines performance
									i.e., proportional to the trust that the model builds on the environment - as a professional driver would from years of experiencing different stimuli on the road and from their vehicles. </p>
