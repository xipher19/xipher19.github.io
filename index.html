									<h1>Security against<br />
									 Generative ML / AI</h1>
									<p>In a world of Generative AI software, it is becoming increasingly<br />
									important to identify counterfeits and generated media. <a class = "scrolly" href="#main-content" style="color:#A9A9A9" >Read on for more.</a></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/AI generated Image - Spectral.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p id="main-content">Generative models, like any creative model, need a basis. We cannot create results out of thin air, and hence need an underlying source of basis, 
									which is either a distribution (and along with it, some stochasticity) or derived from random variables. Let us explore this underlying basis, to arrive at the models’ security concerns and the corresponding solutions naturally.</p>
								<p> The most popular generative frameworks such as Transformers, GANs, Autoencoders, NeRF, etc utilize some form of basis to build and perfect their generation capabilities -
								<ul>
  									<li>In the Transformer framework, the hidden attention layers capture the essence of the open-ended sentences to generate the next word. The basis is the optimization of those layers with gradient descent</li>
  									<li>GAN models rely on latent variables (random continuous variables) that are trained to represent a particular distribution. The basis is the optimization of those variables with gradient descent</li>
  									<li>Autoencoders’ latent variables are a mix of those of GAN and Transformer models</li>
									<li>NeRF relies on a multi-layer ( non convolutional ) network. The basis is the optimization of those variables with gradient descent </li>
								</ul>
								<p>However, generative models have their own suite of inefficiencies: digital media and algorithmic creation of it -</p>
								<ul>
  									<li>Digital (human) media - Digital media is, mathematically speaking, an approximation of analog media. This is due to the approximation nature of data in digital media ( with data represented as bits instead of 
										analog, infinitely-deep real-world entities. Digital art detection is analogous to detecting fakes from originals in real life - we just have to look close enough</li>
  									<li>Algorithmic media - Algorithmic media is a multi level approximation of real media, with the absence of an analog “recording”. As latent variables try to approximate distributions, they tend to lack 
										accuracy in representation, especially with changing environments</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The security concerns of algorithmic media is the ability to generate problematic, immoral, fake and controversial media.</p>
								<p>Algorithmic media can be detected by analyzing the transformations between its states. Given that a limited number of latent variables generate this media, the information represented cannot be lossless.</p>
								<p>As we can only analyze the product of these models, our basis identification starts from the same end result. Most models rely entirely on latent representations to guide their outputs, so we should be tracing these microscopic losses from the same.</p>

								<h3>How do we convert these ideas and theories into software / models? How do we trace these microscopic losses?</h3>

								<p> All ML models have losses to prevent overfitting ( in case the models lack losses, the robustness can be analysed instead ) and the key to building our framework is in the detection and analysis of those microscopic 
									nuanced losses ingrained in the model posteriors.</p>
								
								<p>We can trace pixels or entities with vectors and track the aging of those vectors over space and time. In this way, we can detect microscopic losses in the output of the said models. The interesting nuance with vectors 
									is their ability to work in unison. As we trace bits and pieces of data, the model is working towards the identification of said microscopic losses. Hence, the key to
									developing this model is the coordination between vectors as analysis matures with the progressive interaction of vector neighbors over multiple criteria. Intuitively, as we’re trying to build models with abilities 
									commensurate with those of advanced generative AI models, it is pivotal to deploy models with a higher degree of competency.</p>	

								<p> The associations that are made follow the <b><a href="bead-architecture.html">'bead' architecture</a></b> - each vector realizes its place during their progressive interaction, and after the application of selective criteria, obtains an accurate perception of the medium.</p>

								<h3> Vector Design </h3>

								<p> In contrast to convolutional architectures that emphasize on filters and neural networks, we would take an alternative approach by containing the focus on vectors and systematically evolving them. It is only natural to assume
								that these vectors can be of variable length, depending on the amount of association and nuances they would build. </p>

								<p>Given the variability and versatility of these vectors, we would likely need a supporting vector database with novel operations and structures. <i>I would explore this idea sometime in the near future.</i></p>

								<h4>How many vectors do we need on average?</h4>

								<p>A typical 4K image has approximately 4000 * 2250 pixels, i.e., atmost 9 million vectors. To manage vectors at such a scale, we need them to be lightweight and robust. Their priority should be to collaborate over complex 
								processing as this design strategy would help the architecture rapidly scale up with volume.</p>
