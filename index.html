											<h1>The Beads<br />
									 			Framework</h1>
									 		<p>A micro-collaborative 'bead' ecosystem that enables 
											multi-modal cognition, task autonomy and adaptive intelligence.</p>
										</header>
										<p>The beads architecture is a multimodal cognitive architecture of associative nodes (a.k.a. beads) which perpetually interact with each other, with the assistance of a constructive medium at a rich and fine level. It is modeled after the human brain to replicate high level cognitive functions like neuroplasticity and spatial memory. On its own, the architecture holds “knowledge” but in addition to an 'intent' and the perpetual conduction / constructive medium, it transforms into intelligence tuned to a diverse set of goals.</p>

										<p>As the framework is perpetual, the system lacks distinct training, testing and inference lifecycles. Every operation is performed on live, production-ready beads and concurrency is appropriately controlled. It is important to note that the ecosystem is just an enhanced narrow AI framework (with directed motivation) but falls short of AGI scale autonomy and understanding. This design is intended to target applications requiring high perception and adaptability.</p>

										<p>An important advantage (and sometimes, a disadvantage) of a spatial model is its degrees of freedom. When the Beads model is run for the very first time, it lacks the awareness or the knowledge of its environment. Hence, it is tuned to be in an autopilot mode and continuously learns from stimulus and exposure. Moreover, the quality of training entirely depends on the exposure - not in the classical sense of datasets but rather the multimodal stimuli. It is important to note that the maturity of the model determines its performance i.e., maturity is proportional to the trust that the system builds, of its environment - as an experienced car driver would, from years of encountering different stimuli on the road.</p>

											<h3>Communication Units</h3>
											<p>Specialized modules that are designed to receive, transform and transport external stimuli to the internal beads. They are analogous to our eyes and ears as they bridge the external world to our internal one. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/akhil-reddy/beads/tree/main/beads/components/eru" class="image"><img src="images/ERU.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Environmental Response Units</h3>
											<p>The most important module of beads. A sea of these units create, destroy and hold long & short term memory, biases, house neurotransmitters and route stimulus accordingly. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/akhil-reddy/beads/tree/main/beads/components/focus" class="image"><img src="images/Focus.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Focus</h3>
											<p>Focus is an abstract entity that reduces uncertainty during stimulus routing. While multiple beads can fire at the same time, focus ensures that the "conscious" thought is limited to relevant ERUs. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/akhil-reddy/beads/tree/main/beads/components/neurotransmitters" class="image"><img src="images/Neurotransmitters.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Neurotransmitters</h3>
											<p>In many species, neurotransmitters are entities that magnify / dimnish biological activity. Similarly, neurotransmitters in the Beads ecosystem help in defining biases, personal experiences and such.</p>

											<h3>Special (Conduction) Mediums</h3>
											<p>Conduction Mediums are analogous to the specialized neurons in the human brain (such as the Amygdala) that aid in retention, projection, regulation and such.</p>

											<h3>Motivation Targets</h3>
											<p>The control center of the dynamical system. Motivation targets are defined by the specific application of the Beads Architecture.</p>
