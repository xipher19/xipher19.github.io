										<h1>Components of the Audio CMU</h1>
									</header>

									<p>After additional reading in the past two weeks, I’ve further refined the design of the audio CMU to include biologically accurate functionalities of the pinna and ear canal. I was also focused on the coarse implementations of all audio CMU subcomponents.</p>

										<table>
										  <tr>
										    <th>Component</th>
										    <th>Functionality</th>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Pinna</td>
										    <td>Given its asymmetric structure, the pinna (external ear cartilage) helps with spatial hearing by applying different decibel boosts (through natural resonance) to sounds coming from different directions</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Ear canal</td>
										    <td>The ear canal’s natural frequency helps boost mid-range frequencies and consequently aids in consonant / speech recognition</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Outer hair cells</td>
										    <td>They sharpen / tune frequencies so that subtle pitch differences (in speech and music, for example) are noticeable. Additionally, they boost low frequency sounds while compressing high frequency ones, to improve cochlear sensitivity</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Inner hair cells</td>
										    <td>The core transducer that converts sound waves (which have passed through different media) to electric signals</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>IHC neural transducer</td>
										    <td>Ion channels that react to sound waves and stimulate spike trains</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Ribbon synapse</td>
										    <td>Aids in rapid release of neurotransmitters / stimulus to the auditory nerve</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Efferent modulator</td>
										    <td>Feedback mechanism from the brain (through neurotransmitters) to modulate the OHC gain (by adjusting elasticity of OHC cells on the basilar membrane)</td>
										  </tr>
										  <tr>
										    <td>Spiral ganglion neurons</td>
										    <td>Analogous to the retina’s ganglion cells; a bundle of them form the auditory nerve that ends up in the auditory cortex</td>
										  </tr>

									<h2>Audio CMU Design Updates</h2>

									<ol>
										<li>Outer ear - After a review of related biology research, I realized that the outer ear has functionalities that aid in sound localization and resonant amplification (of consonants). These should help the brain with much needed context for richer memory as well as other higher cognitive functions. In line with the goal of this project, I aim to implement these functionalities as accurately as possible</li>
										<li>Middle ear - A digital microphone already transforms sound energy into electrical signals, so middle ear functionalities aren’t the most critical to implement. Moreover, the middle ear’s contribution to balance and acoustic protection falls outside the scope of the project</li>
